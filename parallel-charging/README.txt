Implementation of parallel charging using RX gates on the qubits of Starmon-5, Quantum Inspire.
Four qubits are charged simultaneously (q1, q2, q3, q4) 
q0 was not working at the time of this experiment.

'parallel charging q0-q1-q2-q3-q4' contains the code and data of all qubits being charged in parallel.
