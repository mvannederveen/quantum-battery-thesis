Implementing charger-mediated energy transfer by using a CNOT gate in Starmon-5, Quantum Inspire. 

Files contain the code and data.
q2 is used as "charger" (or control qubit) in each file. 

'charger mediated charging q2-q1' shows the charging using a CNOT gate between qubit 1 & 2
'charger mediated charging q2-q3' shows the charging using a CNOT gate between qubit 1 & 3
'charger mediated charging q2-q4' shows the charging using a CNOT gate between qubit 1 & 4

qubit 0 was not used in this part as it was not working during the time of this experiment.
'charger mediated charging all'uses the fit values of the other files to plot the charging trajectories of all qubits.
